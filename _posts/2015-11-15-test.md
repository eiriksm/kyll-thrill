##Kyll what?
Yeah, the name is corny, I admit that. It's basically [jekyll](jekyllrb.com) and [mithril](http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/) in one sauce. Plus it kind of sounds bad ass. Disclaimer: I don't see killing as a thrill, personally.

##But kill is spelled with an I and [mithril](http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/) with only one L
Good point. My bad, I guess.

##So what is it?
Yeah, so [mithril](http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/) immediately caught my attention as it is a super slim javascript framework. And I always wanted a blog tool that was super fast, few dependencies, and, most important: 1 HTTP request.

##OK, that's just silly. Or?
Yeah, well, some experiments has shown that reducing the number of HTTP requests is the most important performance factor on mobile. So I stuck to one. And hosting is stable and free through github, and writing markdown posts with jekyll is a breeze.

##But it looks kind of dull!
I agree. I'm no designer. But it's fast, right?

##So how long are you going to drag this fake Q&A out before you link to some code?
Point taken. This site, kyll-thrill source, and hopefully some docs are [all available on github](https://github.com/eiriksm/kyll-thrill). Have a good weekend.

##But this code... I know plenty of ways to make this more awesome!
Great! [Github it is](https://github.com/eiriksm/kyll-thrill) then. This was not the fruits of years of labour, but rather some afternoon hacking.
