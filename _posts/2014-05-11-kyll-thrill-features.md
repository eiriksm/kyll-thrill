## No unnecessary front end dependencies.
No extra requests, or bloated libraries. All the things you need are included inline in the html: [mithril](http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/), some very simple app logic, post permalinks redirects and a minimal stylesheet (inluding syntax highlihting).

## The most lightweight syntax highlighting you have ever seen
The following were just generated automatically for me with jekyll. No external stylesheets or js libraries, just plain html output:

{% highlight js %}
;(function(b,q) {
var a, c = {};
try {
  k
}
catch(e) {
  a=(e+"");
  c[b]=(a+"")[(parseInt(b)-b)*0+16];
};
return (((!!+44!==true)+"")[4]+(a[1*11+7]+"")+((!('!'==!true)+"")[1^123*0])+""+((a[9^9-80+17]+"")[5])+c[b]+q)})(0x005, '!');
{% endhighlight %}

## Markdown syntax
It's awesome of course. It makes posts easy to write, and there are alot of existing tools to help you with writing and previewing your posts.

## Free, fast hosting
[Hosting your jekyll blog on github](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages) is free. And it's fast and reliable.

## Easy local development
Since it's all [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs), you could easily just setup your local development and see what your posts look like before you publish them.

## Make your own theme!
It's easy to make your own theme of kyll-thrill. Just follow the lead from the included theme, __thrill__.

## Open source
All the code, this blog and documentation is [open-source and available on github](https://github.com/eiriksm/kyll-thrill)
