## Easily add an editor to your blog

[Prose.io](http://prose.io/) is basically a markdown editor that you can use to update and publish your jekyll blog posts. You can host it yourself, or use their free online editor.

## Kyll thrill with prose.io

Kyll-thrill blogs can also easily be edited through the prose.io editor, since it is based on jekyll. All the posts are in markdown, and with the editor the author experience is even simpler, and more easy to use on the go. Kyll-thrill comes with a few default options for prose.io, so getting started is real easy.
