A couple of news items:

- The default theme for kyll-thrill is now updated to be easier to read, both for desktops and mobile. 
- Jekyll configurations has been updated to match the latest version.
- I am writing this post on [prose.io](http://prose.io/), and if you are reading this, then it seems kyll-thrill and prose are talking together just fine!
